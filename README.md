# dialogue_analysis
This is the script I wrote to backtrack the Pudding.cool dataset, creating, searching, and parsing url's from their list of IMDB actor IDs, then running images from those parsed htmls through a facial recognition software. All the information was then written to a csv file for use in the champebarton.github.io repo.

The code had to scan through roughly 30,000 actor IDs, and was written to run asynchronously using all the cores on my laptop so that it wouldn't take days to complete. It was my first experience with asynchronous (or parallel) processing. It takes each IMDB id from a csv file of ids, generates a url from it, searches that url, parses the html of the retrieved page in order to get a profile image, then runs that profile image through the Haystack.ai facial recognition software. It then writes the results to a csv.
