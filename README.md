# dialogue_analysis
This is the script I wrote to backtrack the Pudding.cool dataset, creating, searching, and parsing url's from their list of IMDB actor IDs, then using running images from those parsed htmls through a facial recognition software. All the information was then written to a csv file for use in the champebarton.github.io repo.
